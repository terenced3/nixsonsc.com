Statement of Research Philosophy
Nixon S. Chekenya1
Research Philosophy
My research program focuses broadly on the intersection of agricultural economics, climate 
economics, development economics, environmental economics and financial economics focusing
on the Sub-Saharan Africa region. I use methods and theories from economics, finance, 
mathematics and political science to understand problems. Recognizing my obligations to our 
students and the university to maintain currency, to the academic discipline of applied economics
to contribute new knowledge, and to industry professionals to help them solve problems, I
continuously strive to:
• Develop and apply econometric methods, microeconomic theory, mathematical tools in 
solving problems in applied economics.
• Identify opportunities to integrate theoretical and methodological issues across 
economics sub-fields, such as finance, development economics, agricultural economics,
and econometrics.
• Promote collaboration through a within and multidisciplinary modus operandi.
• Share findings widely, including presentation at conferences and in lectures to students to
expose them to state-of-the-art advances in understanding trends in finance.
Research Agenda
I have a strong multidisciplinary research agenda that includes several major streams of research 
in which I would like to engage. I plan to begin a series of papers based on my experience living, 
studying and working in African countries. I am interested in understanding the climate change 
impacts and adaptations by vulnerable groups and smallholder farmers in developing countries, 
including the role of indigenous knowledge systems. I also seek to study the role of microfinance
institutions in local economic development.
Research Effectiveness
I have published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at refereed conferences that attest to 
my quest for producing both quality and relevant science.
